It has the capability to show the current day's weather forecast including temperature, wind speeds, humidity, and risk of rain.
It's accompanied by weather icons corresponding to the day's weather and a short description.
In addtion, there is also a 5-day forecast showing the weather for the next 5 days.

This project is using the OpenWeather API to gather weather information and geocoding.
There are options to type in a desired city to find the current and future weather, or if you allow your browser to use your location, it can detect your current county/city and find the weather there.
